StokesDT provides an object-oriented function interface which can be easily used to develop customized hydrodynamic simulation codes. These APIs are wrapped in static libraries, which can be found in _*install/lib*_. For each main computational kernel in Brownian/Stokesian simulations, StokesDT defines a group of C++ classes, and each of them implements a different method for computing the kernel. Each group of classes generally consists of a base class that contains the abstract interface and a number of derived classes that implements the computational kernels. The base classes defined in StokesDT and their descriptions are listed as follows:

|| Base class || Description ||
|| [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~xliu66/stokesdt/doc/html/classstokesdt_1_1_mob_base.html MobBase] ||Abstract base class for constructing mobility matrix||
|| [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~xliu66/stokesdt/doc/html/classstokesdt_1_1_brwn_base.html BrwnBase] ||Abstract base class for computing brownian displacement vectors||
|| [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~xliu66/stokesdt/doc/html/classstokesdt_1_1_force_base.html ForceBase] ||Abstract base class for computing forces||
|| [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~xliu66/stokesdt/doc/html/classstokesdt_1_1_rnd_stream.html RndStream] ||Random number generator||
|| [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~xliu66/stokesdt/doc/html/classstokesdt_1_1_verlet_list_base.html VerletListBase] ||Abstract base class for Verlet list||

A detailed description of the StokeSDT library and its APIs can be found [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~xliu66/stokesdt/doc/html here]. The StokesDT library can be used for the following purposes.
 * [API#Computing_Mobility_Matrices Computing Mobility Matrices]
 * [API#Computing_Brownian_Displacements/Forces Computing Brownian Displacements/Forces]
 * [API#Computing_External_Forces Computing External Forces]
 * [API#Generating_Random_Vectors Generating Random Vectors]
 * [API#Computing_Verlet_Cell_List Computing Verlet Cell List]

==Computing Mobility Matrices==
The base class [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~xliu66/stokesdt/doc/html/classstokesdt_1_1_mob_base.html MobBase] and its derived classes can be used to compute mobilit matrices. 

The general usage of these classes is as follows:

 
==Computing Brownian Displacements/Forces==

==Computing External Forces==

==Generating Random Vectors==

==Verlet Cell List==
