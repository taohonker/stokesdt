Three input files are needed to perform simulations with StokesDT. The config file (<pre>*</pre>.cfg) specifies all the simulation parameters, which include for example the length of time steps, the type of the simulation algorithm, the types of methods for building mobility matrices and computing Brownian forces, etc. The model file (\*.mod) defines the molecular system to be simulated, including the properties of the particles, and the forces between particles. The XYZ file (\*.xyz) contains the initial positions of the particles. A 

The config file also specifies the optional output from a simulation, which consists of two types of files. The log file (\*.log) contains the track of the simulation, performance statistics, error messages and debugging information. Another file, in the XYZ format (\*.xyz), contains trajectories of particles along the simulation.
