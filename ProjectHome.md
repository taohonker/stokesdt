# What is StokesDT? #
StokesDT is a parallel toolkit for performing large-scale Brownian and Stokesian dynamics simulations on UNIX/LINUX platforms. StokesDT is written in C++ and is optimized for x86-based multicore and Intel MIC-based manycore architectures.

# Highlights #
  * Uses SPME for computing long range hydrodynamic interactions.
  * Uses Lanczos for computing Brownian displacements.
  * Computes bonded forces and steric forces.
  * Can use Intel Xeon Phi accelerators.
  * Provides a flexible, object-oriented user interface which can be used to develop customized hydrodynamic simulation codes.
  * Matlab interface available.

# News #
